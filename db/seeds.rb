# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# The bang versions (e.g. save!) raise an exception if the record is invalid.
# The non-bang versions donâ€™t: save and update_attributes return false, create
# and update just return the objects.
